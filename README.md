A study guide for course pre-work
#  Prework-study-guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for making this project was to learn all of the basic information needed prior to the bootcamp.  
- I made this to help me remember all of the information that i learned during the pre-modules.
- This solves my memory possibly remembering this information incorrectly. 
- I learned far more than I could put into words.  

## Installation

When trying to put this together, I had to follow the steps listed in the pre-work modules.  I had to make the shell of the sections by adding all of the texts for the titles of the sections.  I then had to go in and add the sections for the formatting of the page, i.e., the cards, colors, shadows, etc. Then I went through the Java section to put all of the features in. 

## Usage

Each section contains notes on the topics we went over.  

## Credits

This work is specifically my own with the instruction from the modules listed on the bootcamp website.  

## License

I used the MIT license.
